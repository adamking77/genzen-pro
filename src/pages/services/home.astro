          Our client, a leading financial institution, approached us with a critical challenge: 
          their existing digital platform was struggling to meet the evolving needs of their 
          users and falling behind competitors in terms of user experience and functionality.

        <Text
          tag="p"
          variant="textBase"
          class="text-accent-500 mt-6 text-balance"
        >
          The platform, which served over 500,000 active users, was built on outdated 
          technology that made it difficult to implement new features and maintain consistent 
          performance. Users reported frustration with complex navigation, slow load times, 
          and a lack of modern features they had come to expect from financial services platforms.

          tag="p"
          variant="textBase"
          class="text-accent-500 mt-6 text-balance"
        >
          Additionally, the system's architecture made it challenging for our client's team 
          to quickly respond to market changes and user feedback. They needed a solution that 
          would not only address current pain points but also provide a foundation for future 
          growth and innovation.
